# Project
I created this data set for a Christmas hackathon held at my work place. It was manipulated from data provided about superheros in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/comic-characters.

The data can be used for a supervised machine learning classification problem, to predict whether one will be on Santa's naughty or nice list.

# Deploying
To set up your own personal app, you will need to make an account with StreamLit. It can take some time for your request to be approved. Below is a link to the app I have created.

# Setting Up
A requirements.txt file needs to be created in your GitLab repo in order for Streamlit to function with your code.

# Version History
The versions of packages I have used in this repo are those downloded on my PC through using Juypter Notebook in Anaconda. You may wish to choose different versions.
